        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> I am a newcomer to Canada. Married and father of two teenagers, I immigrated from Egypt to Canada two years ago.
             I first landed in Montréal, but a friend told me to come to Toronto for better job opportunities. 
             I started my life as a Sales Associate in the Duty Free Shops at Toronto Pearson Airport.</p>
