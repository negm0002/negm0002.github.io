        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> I am a newcomer to Canada. Married and father of two teenagers, I immigrated from Egypt to Canada two years ago. 
            I first landed in Montreal, but a friend told me to come to Toronto for better job opportunities.  
            I started my life as a Sales Associate in the Duty-Free Shops at Toronto Pearson Airport.
        </p>
        <p> Due to COVID, I was temporary laid off from my job. 
            I had a passion for design, so I studied Graphic Design at OCAD University for about a year, then I moved to Ottawa recently. 
            The program of Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College attracted me; 
            I started studying this program a month ago and I wish to proceed to become a UX/UI Designer.
